Pirin Nature Reserve - the glory of Bansko. The nature views are really beautiful - mountains, greem grass, streams and lakes. Hiking can take anywhere between 2 hours and several days, so it's a hike available for just about everyone - don't miss it.

Getting to the hike's startpoint (typically Vihren Hut), however, can be a bit tricky. Walking up there takes about 2-3 hours, 1 hour if you use the gondola. There's [a bus](https://visit-bansko.bg/en/helpful/line-bansko-vihren) which travels there and back 3 times a day. You can take a car, a taxi or hitchhike, but note the road closes from 8am to 4pm. The checkpoint is about an hour to the startpoint.
