The Pirin Mountains are unequivocally the most beautiful nature of Bansko. Between the peaks there is green grass, streams, lakes, vegetation, and a view of mountains and valleys stretching into the distance. Hiking can take anywhere between 2 hours and several days. The trails begin at [Vihran Hut](https://goo.gl/maps/AW82T9RxhPQ5WgAd9). Getting to it is in one of the following ways:

- A two-three hour walk on the road or on the ski slope, up the mountain
- A bus that travels and returns 3 times a day only. [This is the timetable](https://visit-bansko.bg/en/helpful/line-bansko-vihren)
- Hitchhiking, car rental, taxi: for all car options, thereâ€™s a road closure from 8am to 4pm. Then you have to walk another hour on the road on foot.
