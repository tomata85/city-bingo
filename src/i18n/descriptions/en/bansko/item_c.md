Bulgaria's culinary scene is mostly wasted on me, a vegetarian who does not care too much for potatoes and creamy dishes. Still, one dish managed to win my heart despite its cheesiness - the banitza - a puff pastry filled with cheese (sometimes also spinach) that comes in a variety of forms and interpretations. Here are places where Banitzas can be found:

- [Billa:](https://goo.gl/maps/XjTKNTNqesaaLGAM6) the supermarket sells freshly baked banitzas, filled with cheese and cheese-spinach. You can also buy a huge frozen Banitza to prepare in your oven, if you are lucky enough to get an apartment with one. Tasty.
- [Banski Samun Artisan Bakery](https://goo.gl/maps/cQ1jsi2N2iSGT4mk9): A bakery that sells huge triangular slices. Come in the morning or order in advance, they’re out by 10am. Tasty.
- [Wake Up](https://goo.gl/maps/AXrEPoKpKTYsRhKA7): A cafe selling cheese or cheese-spinach. Tasty.
- [Fast Food](https://goo.gl/maps/L3nKAnBpmSwG54c47):  “a whole in the wall” right across from coworking Bansko lounge. They sell a cheap and extra greasy banitza roll. Tasty.
- [Street Food](https://goo.gl/maps/R11kv8g6jkVJnjTW6): selling banitzas in a variety of forms and flavors, including potatoes, mushrooms and cabbage. Tasty.
- [Banicharnitsa Vikhren](https://goo.gl/maps/i4D32bvsHBUhp2uy7): Local gypsy bakery with cheap banitzas. Tasty.
- [Le Petite Nicholas](https://goo.gl/maps/QVuetry53Hy97iTT9): Selling a vegan tofu and spinach banitza, a huge pastry that is more like lunch. Tasty.
