Co-working spaces are a thriving industry in Bansko, quite literally an empire of Wi-Fi services, coffee machines and ergonomic chairs. Here’s how to choose between them:

## Coworking Bansko

Bansko's original co-work, to which it owes its great success amongst nomads.

**Location:** All sites are in the old town.

**Convenience of workstations:** I’d give it a 7.5. you have: #1 the site with ergonomic chairs but silence policy #2 the site with cushioned benches and lounge atmosphere and chatter, and #3 the site with ergonomic chairs but underground and no sunlight.

**Membership plans:** In addition to the regular daily, weekly, monthly membership plans, you can also have a one-day-a-week plan, or join only the social events as a 1+. You can come for a trial day.

**Community**: Very much so. There are many events throughout the week, open to co-work members only. The events tend to be crowded with people.

**Equipment:** All spaces have meeting rooms, good coffee machines, milk and its substitutes. There is full kitchen equipment, a yard with grass and hammocks, a trampoline. Some vehicles for hourly rental. Huge amounts of board and box games.

**Best suitable for:** new arrivals in Bansko, who want to meet many new people fast. Those who enjoy a social buzz sounds when working.

## Altspace

The second largest co-work in Bansko.

**Location:** 3 sites, north, central and south.

**Convenience of workstations:** 8. Altspace has a bright and pleasant main space with workstations, some of which are ergonomic, as well as a yard from which you can work. The second space is in the south, bigger and more ergonomic but no A/C. And there is a third ergonomic space on the basement floor in the north of the city. All the spaces radiate a "quiet working" atmosphere.

**Memberships plans:** regular subscription plans (daily, weekly, monthly) + a 30 day pass card for 3 months. You can come for a trial day.

**Community**: there are recurring weekly events (much less than in co-working Bansko). The events are advertised only to co-work members, but are open to everyone.

**Equipment:** All spaces have meeting rooms, coffee machines, milk and its substitutes, microwave. A yard with a hammock and an outdoor couch. Electric scooter for free use. Free printing, free local delivery.

**Best suitable for:** long-term stayers in Bansko. As well as those who like quiet conditions for work, and socializing after hours.

## Nestwork

The co-work that most resembles a high-tech office.

**Location:** Single space, in the north of the city near the park.

**Convenience of workstations:** 9.5. It’s brand new and highly facilitated.

**Membership plans:** 30-day pass for 3 months, or a monthly subscription with two levels of benefits. It’s a cheaper bargain than the above mentioned co-works, probably because of the lack of community emphasis.

**Community**: There is no emphasis on community.

**Equipment:** Meeting rooms, round coffee machines, milk and its substitutes, kitchen equipment. Premium subscribers are also offered bantizas and fruit.

**Best suitable for:** For those who are sensitive to workstation conditions, and require a co-work for working purposes and not for a community.

## Four Leaf Clover

The workspace of the co-living complex Four Leaf Clover (FLC) is mainly used by the guests of the co-living itself, but is also open to the general public.

**Location:** A single space, in the Four Leaf Clover compound which is on the northwest side of the town.

**Convenience of workstations:** 7. Not a big space, reasonable work comfort.

**Membership plans:** In addition to regular membership plans (daily, weekly, monthly), there is a 10 day pass for a month, and also a package deal of residence + workspace membership.

**Community**: You’re added to the co-living WhatsApp group, which is a sweet, organic, self-managed community. They meet a lot for meals, drinks and board games.

**Equipment:** Meeting rooms, a rather sad coffee machine, a microwave, a couch.

**Best suitable for:** For those who live in FLC / whose friends live in FLC / who are interested in connecting with the FLC community; For those who want the slightly more affordable option.

## My personal experience

I signed up for co-working Bansko during my first two summers, during peak season. It was great for creating a community and constructing my social life. In the second summer, at the end of the peak season when people were leaving Bansko, I signed up for FLC, because I had friends there and the price was affordable. During the 3rd summer, when I already knew many people in Bansko in advance, I signed up for Altspace mainly for its proximity to my house, the convenience of work and the attractive 30-day pass, and I occasionally also take part in the social events that do not overwhelm me with their frequency.
