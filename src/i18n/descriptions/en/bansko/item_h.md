Bansko has 2 water reservoirs on its east and west sides. The road to both is about half an hour's walk in each direction; both feature restaurants that serve fresh fish caught in the lake.

- [Belizmata lake](https://goo.gl/maps/2jbtSAibkLmRNrp27): The reservoir on the west side, looks like a small lake. You can also go around the lake and sit on its edge, and it is recommended as a view of the sunset and a view of the mountains.
- [Krinetz dam](https://goo.gl/maps/WwgMDPTMsZPaUQXo9): On the east side. Has a forest view and a flock of geese who made it their home.
