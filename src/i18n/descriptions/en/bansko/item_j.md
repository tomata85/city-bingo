The sunset view in Bansko faces the Pirin mountains and western green fields. My personal recommendation is to watch it from the top of one of the many abandoned buildings. Bring a jacket, a picnic blanket and maybe some wine. Climb the stairs up to the roof and enjoy the open view to the horizon.

If you care to walk a bit, you can watch the sunset from the beautiful [Lake Belizmata](https://goo.gl/maps/8mYk9FJSTsB8M7hu8), west of Bansko. If you don't have dinner there, you might be expected to pay some 3 leva to sit.
