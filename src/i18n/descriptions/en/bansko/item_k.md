Sundays in Bansko regularly feature the [farmer's market](https://goo.gl/maps/X5bLcFdQy63Ex6Aa8). This is both a cute local experience, and an opportunity to stock up your fridge. Not far from the market thereâ€™s also a bazaar market for antiques and 2nd hand clothes, in front of [Bansko Park](https://goo.gl/maps/S8qSok8qrbYG5Wsf9).
