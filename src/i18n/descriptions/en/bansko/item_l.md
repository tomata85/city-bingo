[Bansko Park,](https://goo.gl/maps/S8qSok8qrbYG5Wsf9) in the town's northeastern point, is a cute and green place, with grass lawns, trees, and a small artificial lake with a fountain. If you are downtown and don't have the time or eneergy for hiking further, this is the best option for a nature break.
