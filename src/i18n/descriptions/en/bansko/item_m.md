August is perhaps the best time to visit Summertime Bansko. During summer, Bansko hosts a large number of public events and festivals in the town square. The highlight is definitely the Jazz Festival, a week of local and international shows in the square followed by a jazz jam at the [Ginger bar](https://goo.gl/maps/qE8nhkmDQVoqCzth7). Other than that there's local rock festival, the Opera festival, film screenings and musicals (my personal favorite).
