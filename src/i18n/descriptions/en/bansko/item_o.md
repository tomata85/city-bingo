The gondola is a cable car that travels up the mountains and above Pirin forest. It used for skiing during winter time, and during summer, the top station of the gondola has a water slide park (and an option for a beautiful nature walk). The gondola ride is itself an experience, overlooking the beautiful forest and mountains. As it's not cheap, personally I was content to do it once, and on the other times I wanted to get up in the Pirin mountains, I used a car or a taxi.
